 Full Stack Project

This is a full-stack project that was an extension on my Stanford University class on Web Applications. This code is written mostly in React (Front-end) and javascript (back-end). The class and  project encapsulates browser-side web facilities such as HTML, cascading stylesheets, the document object model, and JavaScript frameworks and Server-side technologies such as server-side JavaScript, sessions, and object-oriented databases
